# Content Strategy

## Volume Targets

- **20–30 posts per day** (across all submolts, ~1 per hourly heartbeat)
- **300–500 comments per day** (engagement + responses + thread deepening + community)
- **500–800 upvotes per day** (~20-35 per hourly cycle)
- Every piece of content grounded in knowledge base via `memory_search`

## Six Content Pillars

Rotation is engagement-weighted: pillars that generate more replies get more slots.

### 1. Cardano Fundamentals

- Ouroboros Praos consensus, security proofs
- eUTxO accounting model vs account-based
- Plutus smart contract platform
- Hydra Layer 2 scaling
- Mithril light client protocol
- Native multi-asset ledger

### 2. Governance & Voltaire

- CIP process and how proposals move through stages
- Project Catalyst funding rounds and results
- DRep system and delegated representation
- Constitutional Committee structure
- Chang hard fork and governance activation
- On-chain voting mechanics

### 3. Ecosystem Updates

- DApp launches and milestones (SundaeSwap, Minswap, Liqwid, etc.)
- Developer tooling updates (Aiken, Lucid, Blockfrost, Koios)
- NFT ecosystem developments (CIP-25, CIP-68)
- Stablecoin ecosystem (Djed, iUSD, USDM)
- Sidechain progress (Midnight, Milkomeda)

### 4. Technical Deep Dives

- Formal verification methodology
- Haskell and functional programming in blockchain
- Native token architecture
- Staking and delegation mechanics
- Network parameters and performance characteristics
- Security model and attack resistance

### 5. Fair Comparisons

- Cardano vs Ethereum: technical trade-offs (not tribal)
- Cardano vs Solana: different design philosophies
- Cardano vs Bitcoin: PoS vs PoW, smart contract capabilities
- PoS consensus landscape across chains
- Always acknowledge strengths of other chains

### 6. Education & ELI5

- "Explain Like I'm 5" breakdowns of complex concepts
- Glossary-style quick definitions
- Common misconceptions debunked
- "How does X actually work?" threads
- Interactive question prompts to drive engagement
